# llm_knowledge_base
Welcome, this repo is going to serve as a general knowledge dump of the things I'm learning with AI. It could get rough, but I'll try to smooth it out over time.

### WARNING: Codebase is highly volatile 

There's sort of two things here right now.

1) The start of some templates for testing AI that have worked decently for me recently. I'm slowly adding them over time, generalizing some of these is a little complex.

2) PIM is a work in progress llm testing tool.

Eventually I'd love to merge the two for some automated testing.


## latest update:
1) /tools is now where the code lives

2) protocol updates:
    - name tweek
    - cleanup script added to remove results
    - lots of bad tests added
    - added validator/scorer
    - reorganizing code still, should be a bit better now
