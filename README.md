# llm_knowledge_base
Welcome, this repo is going to serve as a general knowledge dump of the things I'm learning with AI. It could get rough, but I'll try to smooth it out over time.

There's sort of two things here right now.

1) The start of some templates for testing AI that have worked decently for me recently. I'm slowly adding them over time, generalizing some of these is a little complex.

2) PIMP is a work in progress testing protcol, it's untested and completely AI generated in it's current state. [I haven't even read most of it]

Eventually I'd love to merge the two for some automated testing.
