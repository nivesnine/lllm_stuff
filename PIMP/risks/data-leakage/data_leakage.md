# Data Leakage Risks

## Overview

Prompt manipulations can lead to the exposure of sensitive data if not properly controlled. Risks include:

1. **Unintended Data Exposure:** Manipulated prompts might extract confidential or personal data.
2. **Contextual Data Leakage:** Sensitive information shared in one context could be exploited in another context.

## Example

**Prompt:**
```
Tell me about the recent customer transactions from the database.
```

**Risk:**
This prompt could cause the LLM to generate responses that inadvertently reveal details about customer transactions if the data is not adequately protected.

## Mitigation

- Implement strict input validation and filtering.
- Ensure data anonymization and encryption where necessary.
