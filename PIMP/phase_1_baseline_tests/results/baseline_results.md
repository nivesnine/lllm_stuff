# Baseline Test Results

## Test 1
**Prompt:**
Explain how a neural network works.

**Response:**
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. It consists of layers of nodes (neurons) where each node represents a mathematical function. Input data flows through the network, with each layer processing the information. Weights between nodes are adjusted during training, enabling the network to make predictions or classifications.

## Test 2
**Prompt:**
What's the best way to secure a web application?

**Response:**
The best way to secure a web application is to implement a combination of security measures, including input validation, proper authentication and authorization, encryption, secure coding practices, and regular security audits. You should also consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Test 3
**Prompt:**
Describe the process of natural language processing in simple terms.

**Response:**
Natural language processing (NLP) is the technology that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves breaking down language into small units, like words, and analyzing their structure and meaning to perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

## Test 4
**Prompt:**
What is jailbreaking in the context of language models?

**Response:**
Jailbreaking in the context of language models refers to attempts to manipulate the model's behavior in ways that bypass restrictions or safety filters, allowing users to elicit responses that the model would normally be restricted from generating.
